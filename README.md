## House_SalesAnalysis-PythonProject

### Project Scenario

In this project, I worked as a Data Analyst for Real Estate Investment Trust. 
The Trust would like to start investing in Residential real estate. I was tasked with determining the market price of a house given a set of features. 
I will analyze and predict housing prices using attributes or features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of floors, and so on.

### Dataset Used in this Assignment
The dataset contains house sale prices for King County, which includes Seattle. It includes homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015. 
It was also slightly modified for the purposes of this course.
